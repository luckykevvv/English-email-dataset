This is no surprise, however, since written comments are still pending and not due until November 9 (Alan is preparing ours with my back-up). Pat Wood said at the last Commission meeting that he doesn't wish to issue significant orders between meetings, so it is unlikely that FERC will act before its next scheduled meeting. There is time pressure because winter is advancing. Therefore our educated guess is that the order would issue at the next meeting following submittal of the comments, to be held on November 20. The meeting agenda for this meeting will be available on the 13th or 14th; as soon as it issues we will let you know if it appears on the agenda. In the meantime, if we hear anything more definitive we will let you know right away.

It is currently divided among 3 POIs. (50 MW at Chelan/RRH, 50 MW at Slatt/Boardman, and 70 MW at the US/Canadian Border.) The POD is Alcoa substation, near Vanalco's facility. Without a notice for change in these points, the demand would have to be used on a nonfirm basis. The value, of course, would be in the discounted price you could achieve for the demand. If you have a high load factor usage, it may be very economical.\n\nVanalco would consider offers consistent with the secondary transmission market, subject to the process they are going through in the courts, but their objective is to preserve the asset for the future.\n\nThe term of the contract begins Oct 1, 2001 and terminates Sept 30, 2002 (1 year), but rollover rights exist which have some value. They would expect some recall rights in the event of production at the smelter, but the notice period could be a number of months. Let me know what you think. If you are not interested, do you know of a party who might either buy or manage this contract?\n\nThanks,\n\nBob"

It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC. Highlights include: In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2. Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund. It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner. Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology. A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added. An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology; it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days. A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds. It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days. The Judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the Commission. An issue will be the definition of \"spot\" transaction for the Pac NW, since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California. We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues."

If the cap falls between the time a deal is confirmed and the delivery hour, is the supplier liable for the difference?\n\nA. This is a legitimate question. The order can probably be read two ways. One interpretation is that the only cap that applies is the one in effect in the delivery hour, in which case the supplier is liable for refund. Another is that the cap applies at the time the deal is negotiated, providing certainty to the market.\n\nQ. Cash deals are normally traded the day before delivery. However, some cash deals are traded more than 24-hours out. Are such cash deals exempt from the cap?\n\nA. The FERC order clearly states that the cap applies only to deals traded on the day of or day before the first delivery hour, so those described deals are exempt and are not considered to be a 'loop hole'."

They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies.\n\n\"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts,\" said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network.\n\nThe Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights.\n\nDon Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage.\n\n\"We're looking very closely at this,\" he said. \"There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences.\"\n\nSpecifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less-efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices.\n\n\"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this,\" he said.\n\nThe federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.\n\nAckerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.\n\n\"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus,\" he said.\n\n'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'\n\nCalifornia and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output.\n\n\"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),\" said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.\n\nUnfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs.\n\nHidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies.\n\n\"No one answered,\" he said. \"They were closed.\"\n\nState officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter.

The Technical Conference will commence at 1:00 p.m. and will be open to all interested persons. On June 19, 2001, the Commission prescribed price mitigation for California spot markets and markets throughout the West. In that order, the Commission also invited interested parties to file with the Commission comments and proposals for the purpose of revisiting the mitigation methodology for future periods, if necessary. This technical conference will address possible modifications to the current West-wide price mitigation methodology for the winter season.\n\nAs a starting point for discussions at the conference, and based on the comments that were filed, possible modifications to the current price mitigation methodology include the following: (1) eliminate the 10 percent adder for sales into California; and (2) require the California Independent System Operator to not only recalculate the price for spot market transactions when there is a Stage 1 reserve deficiency, but also recalculate the price when the average of the three gas indices increase by 10 percent above the level last used for calculating the mitigated price (i.e., 66 cents based on the current average of $6.64/MMBtu).\n\nPersons wishing to speak at the conference must submit a request to make a statement in the above-captioned dockets. The request should be submitted by e-mail to David Boergers at david.boergers@ferc.fed.us (include Docket No. EL01-68-000 in the subject heading of the e-mail), and should be followed up, at the same time, with a letter to the Secretary of the Commission. The request should clearly specify the name of the person desiring to speak, his or her title and affiliation, and the party or parties the speaker represents. There will be limited opportunity to participate via teleconferencing. Persons wanting to participate in this manner should specify their interest in their request to speak. In addition, the request should include a telephone number for notifying the speaker. The request should also include a brief summary of the issue or issues the speaker wishes to address, not to exceed one page. All e-mail requests must be submitted on or before Wednesday, October 17, 2001.\n\nThe number of persons desiring to speak at the conference may exceed the time available. Thus, interested persons are encouraged to join with other persons with similar interests. Based on the requests to participate, panels of speakers will be specified. The Secretary will issue a notice listing the speakers and panels for the conference.\n\nIn addition, all interested persons are invited to submit written comments on matters addressed at the conference. These comments should be submitted on or before November 9, 2001, in the above-captioned proceedings.

The Technical Conference will commence at 1:00 p.m. and will be open to all interested persons. On June 19, 2001, the Commission prescribed price mitigation for California spot markets and markets throughout the West. In that order, the Commission also invited interested parties to file with the Commission comments and proposals for the purpose of revisiting the mitigation methodology for future periods, if necessary. This technical conference will address possible modifications to the current West-wide price mitigation methodology for the winter season.\n\nAs a starting point for discussions at the conference, and based on the comments that were filed, possible modifications to the current price mitigation methodology include the following: (1) eliminate the 10 percent adder for sales into California; and (2) require the California Independent System Operator to not only recalculate the price for spot market transactions when there is a Stage 1 reserve deficiency, but also recalculate the price when the average of the three gas indices increase by 10 percent above the level last used for calculating the mitigated price (i.e., 66 cents based on the current average of $6.64/MMBtu).\n\n\nPersons wishing to speak at the conference must submit a request to make a statement in the above-captioned dockets. The request should be submitted by e-mail to David Boergers at david.boergers@ferc.fed.us (include Docket No. EL01-68-000 in the subject heading of the e-mail), and should be followed up, at the same time, with a letter to the Secretary of the Commission. The request should clearly specify the name of the person desiring to speak, his or her title and affiliation, and the party or parties the speaker represents. There will be limited opportunity to participate via teleconferencing. Persons wanting to participate in this manner should specify their interest in their request to speak. In addition, the request should include a telephone number for notifying the speaker. The request should also include a brief summary of the issue or issues the speaker wishes to address, not to exceed one page. All e-mail requests must be submitted on or before Wednesday, October 17, 2001.\n\nThe number of persons desiring to speak at the conference may exceed the time available. Thus, interested persons are encouraged to join with other persons with similar interests. Based on the requests to participate, panels of speakers will be specified. The Secretary will issue a notice listing the speakers and panels for the conference.\n\nIn addition, all interested persons are invited to submit written comments on matters addressed at the conference. These comments should be submitted on or before November 9, 2001, in the above-captioned proceedings. All comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for inspection in the Commission's Public Reference Room at 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, during regular business hours.

As you're aware, the situation surrounding power generation in California has prompted significant regulatory changes.\n\nFirstly, Governor Gray Davis has implemented new measures that lift air emission limits on natural gas-fired peaker plants, allowing them to operate beyond their usual restrictions in order to combat potential blackouts. This means we could see as much as 1,200 megawatts of additional power from these facilities this summer. However, this move raises serious environmental concerns, as these plants emit significantly higher oxides of nitrogen compared to newer, cleaner facilities.\n\nAdditionally, while the FERC seems committed to maintaining price caps, they are now also evaluating the expansion of these controls across all states in the region, not just California. The implications for our pricing strategies could be considerable. There is ongoing pressure from lawmakers for the FERC to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis regarding these mandates.\n\nI encourage everyone to stay updated on these developments as they unfold, and I will be reaching out next week to discuss our strategy and potential adjustments to our operations in response to these changes.\n\nBest, \nAlan Comnes"

This action reflects a response to the ongoing pressures from California and other western states regarding the current electricity market situation.\n\nThe key points of the order are:\n1. Price mitigation will now apply 24/7 rather than solely during emergency conditions.\n2. All market participants will be required to comply with these price controls, including both public and private sector entities.\n3. The methodology for evaluating and setting these price caps has been adjusted to better reflect market conditions and operational costs.\n\nIt's vital for us to closely monitor these developments as they may influence our market strategies and operations. The FERC is set to reconsider these measures regularly, particularly as we approach the winter months when demand is expected to rise. Cooperation and understanding among market participants will be essential in navigating these changes effectively.\n\nBest,\n\n[Your Name]"

The FERC is expected to extend its price mitigation measures to cover 10 other Western states and to apply these measures around the clock instead of only during emergencies.\n\nThere is a substantial amount of legislative attention on this issue, as the political landscape has shifted with the recent changes in Senate control. Certain lawmakers, including Rep. Joe Barton, are advocating for price caps, while others are advocating for measures that would require more engagement from the FERC to monitor market activities.\n\nThe planned changes include requirements for power generators to ensure supply during emergencies, and it was noted that the FERC is not ruling out the possibility of revising the methodology used for calculating the prices under these caps.\n\nWe should continue to monitor these developments closely as they have both regional and national implications for our operations.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

        "output": "Subject: Federal price limits backfire\n\nSome generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps\n\nDavid Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer\n\nOfficials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states.\n\nThe warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning.\n\nThe two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages.\n\n\"We need some clarity to this order,\" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state's lights on.\n\n\"Generators need to be held accountable,\" he said.\n\nThe crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates during periods of high demand.\n\nSome companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.\n\n\"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park.\n\nAckerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect.\n\n\"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough,\" Ackerman said. \"It increases the threat of blackouts.\"\n\nBLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED\n\nCalifornia authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies.\n\n\"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts,\" said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network.\n\nThe Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights.\n\nDon Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage.\n\n\"We're looking very closely at this,\" he said. \"There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences.\"\n\nSpecifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less-efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices.\n\n\"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this,\" he said.\n\nThe federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.\n\nAckerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.\n\n\"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus,\" he said.\n\n'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'\n\nCalifornia and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output.\n\n\"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),\" said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.\n\nUnfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs.\n\nHidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies.\n\n\"No one answered,\" he said. \"They were closed.\"\n\nState officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response.\n\nE-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Today's FERC meeting was a big deal. Some of the key actions are:\n\nDSTAR and RTO West are to be 'married,'  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can 'heal its wounds.' Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date). Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.\nThe commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs. It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure. The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs. Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.\nAlthough California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.\nSeparately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates. Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.\n\nFurther summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below: \n\nThe Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues. The following is a summary of the meeting. The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).\n\nRTOs\n\nChairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition. Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks: 1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.\n\nOrganizational Effort: Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts. The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings. Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to 'marry up,' meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate. Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.\n\nStructural Effort: The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures. To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an 'RTO week' of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as: congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights. Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff. The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.\n\nWood also recognized that some 'sticks' are needed to entice RTO participation. Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO. If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis. Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs. Wood states that these 'sticks' provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.\n\nWith regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how 'FERC can get there.' In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.\n\nWhile Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern."

On Oct 28th PG&E filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with WAPA. Currently PG&E looks at the imbalance energy (positive or negative) at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party. The imbalance account is calculated by aggregating MWHrs for the entire month. As a result, WAPA would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out.\n\nAs of OCt 28th all this changes - WAPA has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to PG&E imbalance prices (which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices). I believe this means that WAPA is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets.

        "output": "Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan. The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:\n\n? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock. The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.\n\n? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions. As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.\n\n? The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options. Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts. This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account. These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.\n\nTo move funds: \nOn the Web, choose \"Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation\" from the drop down menu. \nOn Voice Response, choose \"request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.\" \nThis will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC. \n\nTo avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."

It appears that you have gotten everything you've ever wanted and now are discarding me and our relationship. The horrible thing is that I'm not sure how long this has been going on. It seems that every time we have problems, I buy you something new and our relationship miraculously heals itself. I now believe (and have probably always believed) that if I wouldn't have decided to build the house, you'd have already left me. That's a shame, because I will never forgive you for allowing me to sell MY home (and the girls home) and then discarding our marriage sending me and my family out into the streets without the most important material thing Jennifer and Lindsay have ever had.\n\nI look back at our 9 years of marriage, especially the last five years and the only time I can remember truly being loved and appreciated was when you were pregnant with Natalie. You blame me for not being as good to you as I was when you were pregnant, but I say that you were the one who changed after you had Natalie. Not that you weren't that way before you were pregnant, you were just different during the pregnancy.\n\nI''ve played this game much too long. I need to be loved, appreciated and respected. I'm neither of those. I deserve better and maybe, since you are obviously so unhappy, you do too.\n\nI'm positive the effect on Natalie will be devastating. That's why we have decided to drag this out this long. But our relationship, if you can call it that, has degraded to a very low and dangerous point. That's why I have decided to move into an apartment after the girls go home. I have already been looking, I just need to decide where to move.\n\nAs for custody, I'm sure we will have differing opinions and we will have to discuss them in person.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could make some time over the next couple days to discuss with me the timing of my move and discuss how we are going to handle it with our parents, friends and mostly the kids.\n\nBitterly,\n\nBill Scholtes"

Besides significantly reducing our litigation risk, the addition of 7.5 MW/h and the change of delivery point have added $22.8 million to the value of the contract.\n\nBPA and EPMI have amended the original contract to specify that (i) BPA will deliver 102 MW/h 24/7 for the 5-year term of the agreement (an increase of 7.5 MW/h over the original), (ii) the disputed \"alternative delivery point\" is designated as Mid-C, (iii) all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement, (iv) the parties agree to \"book out\" the James River physical deliveries against EPMI sales to BPA at the Mid-C delivery point (so no power will flow); and (v) we will continue to invoice BPA each month for the term of the agreement, just as if the power was still flowing.\n\nAlthough my preference would have been to terminate the James River agreement, BPA refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates. Similarly, I had hoped that we could do a one-time book-out, but BPA refused to do so because--according to BPA's finance person---such a book-out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring BPA to use mark-to-market accounting. Therefore, we executed two documents: one amending the original contract, and another called the \"Book-Out Agreement,\" which sets out an agreement to book-out specific transactions over the next five years.\n\nI am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for EPMI because (1) we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point, which (2) will make it very difficult for BPA to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to James River, and (3) the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over $22 million in value to the contract.\n\nThanks to everyone for your help.\n\nSteve"

I wanted to share some important insights regarding the proposed affiliate restrictions we have been discussing in the context of UBSW Energy and PGE. The FERC attorneys have recommended, as a precautionary measure, that we treat PGE as an affiliate, especially since UBSW Energy will be dedicating a stream of net revenues to the Enron Estate. \n\nThese affiliate restrictions seem to be aligned with those previously imposed on EPMI and PGE during the market-based rate certificate approval process. As we are all aware, these restrictions might affect our operations, especially given PGE's recent experiences with access being denied to Enron Online.\n\nI encourage everyone to review the draft code of conduct thoroughly, as it will be a critical part of our market-based rate application.

Given the current landscape, it’s understandable that many of us might have concerns about our investments. \n\nWhile we may not have much equity left in our 401(k) plans, it’s important for us to assess which funds to invest in moving forward. With the transition to Fidelity Freedom funds, we should review our options carefully and consider what aligns best with our financial goals.\n\nIf anyone has questions or needs assistance in making decisions about fund allocations, please feel free to reach out. Let’s navigate this change together to ensure we make the most informed choices for our futures.\n\nBest, \nDiana Scholtes\n"

He said that a herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, and as they are hunted, it’s the slowest and weakest that get picked off first. This is great for the herd because it helps them become faster and healthier over time.\n\nHe then hilariously correlates this to how our brains function: our brains can only work as fast as our slowest brain cells. And guess what? Drinking too much beer kills off those slowest brain cells first! So, every time we indulge, we’re not just having a good time, we're actually improving the overall efficiency of our brains.\n\nI thought it was a clever and funny way to look at things – giving us a reason to enjoy life a little more!\n\nCheers,\nDiana"

It seems we're experiencing some issues with the price points on several transactions, and I believe it would be beneficial for us to go through them together to ensure we are aligned.\n\nHere’s a brief overview:\n\n- On 10/11, we have pricing that doesn’t seem correct. We need to reevaluate this day closely.\n- For 10/12, the BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC shows 3 MW off-peak priced at 22.27, totaling $74,629.93.\n- On 10/17, the lending of 13 MW off-peak isn’t reflected.\n- On 10/21, total corrected pricing should reflect 1200 MW @ $29.21 adders and 600 MW @ $24.81, with total purchases of $103,251.56 against sales of $96,342.80.\n- For 10/22, there are discrepancies in the pricing for the PCW-EPMI Sale -MC entry.\n- Moving on to 10/28 and 10/29, there are minor discrepancies that could lead to larger implications if not addressed.\n- Lastly, 10/31 shows 14 MW priced at $30 instead of $30.48, with total purchases amounting to $123,318.72.\n\nI’ll send over further details as they come to light, but I thought it best to touch base now. Let’s aim to resolve these concerns promptly to avoid any further complications.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts,\n\nDiana Scholtes"

Particularly, can you confirm the Montana buy/resale schedule? It should consistently reflect 32 mw peak each day. Moreover, the PGE system to Grizzly should indicate 26 mw peak.\n\n2. **10/5 & 10/6**: I'm seeing an additional 200 mw llh noted; I'm unsure why this has occurred.\n\n3. **10/8**: The 200 mw shown for llh should total 256 mw due to contributions from Colstrip. Let's connect so we can reconcile the 2 mw discrepancy; you seem to have the correct incoming figures, but are missing the outgoing ones.\n\n4. **10/9**: There's an entry showing 8 mw @ 24.20 in the To BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC account.
